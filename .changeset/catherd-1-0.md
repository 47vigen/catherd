catherd 1.0: a rewrite, and a clean break from 0.x. Run `bunx catherd-cli init` once after upgrading; it moves your 0.x files aside and sets 1.0 up (see MIGRATION.md).

- **Runs that survive.** Every worker runs detached under a supervisor with idle and wall timeouts, writes straight to disk and is recorded exactly once, even when the MCP server restarts mid-run. Admission is atomic, parallel lanes are checked for overlapping files, and a write outside a lane is reported.
- **Three backends behind one adapter:** Codex, headless Claude Code (`claude-code:` rungs, beside native Claude subagents) and opencode v2 (OpenCode Go and Zen). Each has a probe with a minimum version, optional isolation, and per-role access (`read-only`, `workspace-write`, `full`) with how strongly the backend enforces it.
- **A discovery catalog.** catherd lists what each backend offers, scores models from dated sources, ranks cost by how you pay (plan, subscription or per token), and lets you map an unscored model with `treat-like`. Jev is optional: without a key, each lane's own Kind and Difficulty route it.
- **Profiles, schema 1:** per-role ladders, access, failover to a rung on another quota, a budget and timeouts, kept through `catherd profile`, the TUI or `/catherd-setup`; native Claude roles get linked agent files.
- **A full CLI:** `init`, `doctor` (one row per check, each with its fix), `profile`, `status`, `watch`, `runs`, `catalog`, `lock` and `capture-fixtures`, with stable exit codes, one-line errors and a log with secrets redacted.
- **A new TUI** after opencode's: Status, Profiles and Runs tabs, a command palette, and edits that are saved only through a diff.
- **20 MCP tools**, two of them new (`cancel`, `record_agent_run`); every failure is `{ code, message, fix }`.
- Needs Bun 1.4 or newer.
